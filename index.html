			<h1>Benjamin's Immigrant Story</h1>
			<p>
				All of my grandparents and my parents are immigrants. They emigrated from the second biggest country in the world, the heart of Europe, the land of the long white cloud, and the leader of the commonwealth. They did it in different times, different ways, and different reasons.

			<p>Nana was the first to leave her home country. She left in 1959 at age 5. She left England by ship on the last voyage of the Captain Cook. She went to New Zealand with her four sisters and her mother and father.</p>
			<p>Grandad immigrated to Australia and then to New Zealand from Canada in 1972. He was 20 and traveled by airplane. He left behind his two brothers and four sisters and traveled on his own.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda immigrated next in 1986 when they were 48 and 43. (Babi – 43 Děda – 48) They came from the Czech Republic and waited in a migrant camp in Austria until Canada accepted them and then immigrated. They traveled by car and then airplane. They went to Canada.</p>

			<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
			<p>My grandparents did it for different reasons too.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda did it because Europe was overcrowded and there was war, required military service, pollution, and almost no nature. They wanted to go to a place that had a lot of nature and they wanted to have freedom so Daddy could have lots of opportunity to go to school and be successful.</p>
			<p>Nana did it to join family and because there was free passage. They went to join Nana's Aunt and Uncle and Grandparents who ran a farm. The passage was free because they wanted people to live in and populate New Zealand.</p>
			<p>Grandad was just going on an adventure around the world. He planned to go to Australia and figure his way from there. He wanted to go there because nobody else was going there and it was the farthest he could go. Everybody else was going to Europe and Grandad wanted to have a different adventure.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C3">
			<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
			<p>Our grandparents felt differently too.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda felt confused about uncertain future because they had to:</p>
			<li>learn the language</li>
			<li>find a job</li>
			<li>find a place to live</li>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Nana was a little kid so she thought of it as an adventure!</p>
			<p>Grandad felt nervous and scared because he didn’t know anybody but he was excited because it was an adventure.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C4">
			<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
			<p>Some of our grandparents found it hard to move.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda’s hardest thing was that the rules were that once you left you couldn’t come back and your friends couldn't contact you. They left behind friends and family including Daddy's half-brother Radek. It was a hard decision.</p>
			<p>Leaving family was Grandad’s hardest thing. He couldn't send letters because it was too expensive. He couldn't phone them because that was also too expensive. Once he didn't have any money left! He was lonely in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>Nana’s hardest thing was the long ship ride. It was the last ride of the Captain Cook. It went across the equator so it was really hot. She got her hair cut because shorter hair made her feel cooler. It was a funnel ship (a steam ship).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C5">
			<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
			<p>But really, was it the best idea to immigrate?</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda thought so because they were able to achieve:</p>
			<li>a good job</li>
			<li>Daddy was able to go to university</li>
			<li>a good house</li>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Nana thinks so too because she lived happily ever after.</p>
			<p>So did grandad because if he stayed in Canada he wouldn’t experience different cultures because he went all around the world not just New Zealand.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="Conclusion">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>All of my grandparents think it definitely was the best idea to immigrate because if they didn’t they wouldn’t have ME! (or this book.)</p>

			<h2>My Method</h2>
			<p>These are the steps that I followed to make my story:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>I interviewed my Grandparents</li>
				<img src="Interviews.jpg">
				<li>I wrote a rough draft</li>
				<img src="Draft.jpg">
				<li>My Mum helped me type up my draft</li>
				<li>I fixed my spelling and grammar</li>
				<img src="Editing.jpg">
				<li>Mum helped me write it up on the computer for this website</li>
				<li>I picked formats and colors and helped code them</li>
				<li>We put our file online and sent it to Mr. Brenny</li>
				<li>I breathed a sigh of relief that it was all over and went to play <a href ="http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1">Plants versus Zombies</a></li>
