			<h1>Benjamin's Immigrant Story</h1>
			<p>
				All of my grandparents and my parents are immigrants. They emigrated from the second biggest country in the world, the heart of Europe, the land of the long white cloud, and the leader of the commonwealth. They did it in different times, different ways, and different reasons.

			<p>Nana was the first to leave her home country. She left in 1959 at age 5. She left England by ship. She went to New Zealand.</p>
			<p>Grandad immigrated to Australia and then to New Zealand from Canada in 1972. He was 20 and traveled by airplane.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda immigrated next in 1986 when they were 48 and 43. (Babi – 43 Děda – 48) They came from the Czech Republic and waited until Canada accepted them and then immigrated. They traveled by car and then airplane. They went to Canada.</p>

		<section id="C2">
			<h2>Chapter 2</h2>
			<p>My grandparents did it for different reasons too.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda did it because Europe was overcrowded and there was wars, required military service, pollution, and almost no nature.</p>
			<p>Nana did it to join family and because there was free passage.</p>
			<p>And Grandad was just going on an adventure around the world.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C3">
			<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
			<p>Our grandparents felt differently too.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda felt confused about uncertain future because they had to:</p>
			<li>learn the language</li>
			<li>find a job</li>
			<li>find a place to live</li>
			<p>Nana was a little kid so she thought of it as an adventure!</p>
			<p>Grandad felt nervous and scared because he didn’t know anybody but he was excited because it was an adventure.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C4">
			<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
			<p>Some of our grandparents found it hard to move.</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda’s hardest thing was that the rules were that once you left you couldn’t come back and your friends could contact you.</p>
			<p>Leaving family was Grandad’s hardest thing so was not being able to send letters and he was lonely in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>Nana’s hardest thing was the long ship ride. It was the last ride of the Captain Cook. It went across the equator. It was really hot. She got her hair cut. It was a funnel ship (a steam ship).</p>
		</section>
		<section id="C5">
			<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
			<p>But really, was it the best idea to immigrate?</p>
			<p>Babi and Děda thought so because they were able to achieve:</p>
			<li>a good job</li>
			<li>Daddy was able to go to university</li>
			<li>a good house</li>
			<p>Nana thinks so too because she lived happily ever after.</p>
			<p>So did grandad because if he stayed in Canada he wouldn’t experience different cultures because he went all around the world not just New Zealand</p>
		</section>
		<section id="Conclusion">
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>All of my grandparents think it definitely was the best idea to immigrate because if they didn’t they wouldn’t have ME! (or this book.)</p>
